I encourage Power BI authors around the world to clone this project and start reporting similar info in their locations. Data recording is in a simple Excel table. Please register for Mapbox and replace the API key.

Media reporting can be vague and hard for the public to collate. Relying on social media can be misleading. Power BI can help.
