Coronavirus COVID-19 - Victoria Australia

Lists recent Coronavirus COVID-19 exposure sites in the state of Victoria, Australia.

THIS REPORT IS NOT HEALTH ADVICE - REFER TO YOUR LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITY.

Exposure sites from the last 20 days are shown by default - use the date slicers to control the date range. 

The map visual gives a quick overview, as many of the specific locations will be unfamiliar to residents and are scattered among various media releases and news stories.  Hover over a map point for more info, or select a map point or multiple points to filter the other visuals.

The timeline and table visuals show more details, including the expected date for "Onset of symptoms up to".  This is derived using the commonly used 14-day window.  

Data was gathered from:

I encourage Power BI authors around the world to clone this project and start reporting similar info in their locations. Data recording is in a simple Excel table. Please register for Mapbox and replace the API key.

Media reporting can be vague and hard for the public to collate. Relying on social media can be misleading. Power BI can help.
